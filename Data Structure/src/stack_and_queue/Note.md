***Points to remember***

Stack fallows LIFO( Last in First out) property 

it means the last one add or push element will be remove first on pop operation

Queue fallows FIFO( First in First Out) property

it means that first element add in queue will be remove first 

for understand in stack the rightmost element will be remove

and in queue the leftmost element will be remove
