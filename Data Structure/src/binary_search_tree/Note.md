 *NOTE*
 
 The array for binary_search tree must be a *sorted data array*
 
 Why mid as parent root data?
 
 Because in sorted data array before mid data's is less than mid and
 
 After mid data's or greater than mid.
 
 Which is satisfied the condition of root parent node of binary search tree.
 
 >> Logic
 
 For less than mid left node
 0 to mid-1
 
 For greater than mid right node
 mid+1 to array size -1
