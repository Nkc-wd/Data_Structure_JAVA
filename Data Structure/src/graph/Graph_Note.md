**Graph**

It is Group of vertex or vertices and edges that are used to connect these vertices.

A Graph can be seen as a cyclic tree,

Where the nodes maintain any complex relationship among them

instead of having parent child relationship.

* Here Generic HashMap for O(1) to add and get is use to store vertex **as String** & 

edge as **Integer reference**
