  **Kruskal Algorithm**
  
  Kruskal Algorithm is to find the minimum spanning cost spanning tree
  
  uses the Greedy Algorithm .
  
  First we add the minimum weighted edge and take care of no cyclic loop form or 
  
  Graph is disconnected.
  
  
  
  **Prim's Algorithm**
  
  Actually in kruskal we consider minimum weight edge first that contains to vertices,
  
  But in prims we consider a Node & check corresponding which edge's weightage is minimum.
