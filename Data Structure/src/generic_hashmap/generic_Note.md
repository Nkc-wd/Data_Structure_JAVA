In collections we always need of type casting.

To make code optimize and solve of type casting Generic is very important.

**simply generic initialize by **<Type>** 

The important note is We have to write Data type As Class like

>> Integer

>> String

>> Boolean

If we want any type just wrote <Type> and use that Type

Usually that types:

T - Type

E - Element

K - Key

N - Number

V - value

**In ArrayList we can not give any type only primitive data type as class**

ArrayList<Integer> list=new ArrayList<>();
